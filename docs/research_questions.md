# Research Questions

## RQ1
How are everyday bodily and social practices (food, alcohol, music, clothing, rituals) used to localize the Homeric myth in different cultural contexts, and can these localization strategies be identified through computational text analysis?

## RQ2
Which lexical fields, motifs, and recurring objects in *Odyssey*, *Ulysses*, and *Eneida* correspond to culturally specific markers, and how do their frequencies and co-occurrences reveal patterns of everyday life in Irish, Ukrainian, and ancient Greek settings?

## RQ3
How do narrative structures and character interactions reflect cultural adaptation of the Homeric myth, and can network modeling of these interactions expose hidden correspondences between the texts?

## RQ4
What role do symbolic objects and recurrent scenes (e.g., drinking, feasting, music-making, clothing) play in differentiating cultural interpretations, and how can computational co-occurrence and collocation analyses quantify these patterns?

## RQ5
Can visualizations (graphs, heatmaps, network diagrams) effectively represent the distribution and relational patterns of cultural markers across texts, and what insights do these visualizations provide for comparative literary interpretation?

## RQ6
How does integrating close reading and distant reading techniques enhance our understanding of myth localization, and what methodological insights can be drawn about cross-cultural literary analysis in the Digital Humanities context?

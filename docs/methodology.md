### Language Mediation and Translation Bias

This project operates on translated and original texts across different languages.
The *Odyssey* is analyzed in English translation, while *Ulysses* is analyzed in its original English form,
and *Eneida* is analyzed in its Ukrainian burlesque adaptation.

As a result, the lexical comparison does not aim at direct linguistic equivalence,
but at **functional-semantic equivalence** within defined cultural domains
(food, alcohol, ritual, travel, etc.).

The goal is not to compare identical words,
but to compare **how often and how densely each cultural domain is activated**
within each narrative tradition.

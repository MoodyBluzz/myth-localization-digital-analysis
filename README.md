# Myth Localization and Everyday Culture: A Digital Humanities Project

This project explores how everyday material and bodily practices 
(food, alcohol, music, clothing, rituals) function as cultural markers 
in different reinterpretations of the Homeric epic tradition.

Using computational text analysis and network-based visualizations,
the study compares James Joyce’s *Ulysses* (1922), Homer’s *Odyssey* (8th century BCE), and 
Ivan Kotliarevsky’s *Eneida* (1808) to examine strategies of myth localization
in Irish modernism and Ukrainian early modern literature.

## Methods
- Corpus-based lexical analysis
- Co-occurrence and collocation analysis
- Network modeling of cultural markers
- Comparative interpretation (close + distant reading)

## Status
Project initialization and research design.
